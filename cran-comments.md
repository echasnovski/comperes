## Submission details

This is a maintenance update:
- A minor bug fix.
- Reaction to 'rlang' package update to version 0.3.0.

## Test environments
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (local install), R 3.4.4
* macOS 10.11 El Capitan (on R-hub), R 3.5.0 (2018-04-23)
* Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 (32/64 bit) (on R-hub), R-devel (2018-09-27 r75377)
* Debian Linux (on R-hub), R-devel (2018-10-05 r75407), GCC

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* Note is to CRAN maintainers.

---

On some platforms on R-hub there was WARNING:

* checking top-level files ... WARNING
Conversion of ‘README.md’ failed:
pandoc: Could not fetch https://travis-ci.org/echasnovski/comperes.svg?branch=master

  This seems like pandoc issue on particular platforms. Local Ubuntu check doesn't have that.

## Reverse dependencies

There is one reverse dependency: 'comperank' package. No problem found (I am also its maintainer).
